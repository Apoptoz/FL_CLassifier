  abstract = {In this paper we present two novel approaches for on-line evolving fuzzy classifiers, called eClass and FLEXFIS-Class. Both methods can be applied with different model architectures, including single model (SM) with class labels as consequents, classification hyper-planes as consequents, and multi-model (MM) architecture. Additionally, eClass can have a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) architecture with multiple hyper-planes as consequents of each fuzzy rule. The difference between MM and MIMO architectures is that the former one applies one separate and independent fuzzy rule-based (FRB) classifier for each class and is using an indicator labelling scheme, while the latter one applies a single FRB where the rules are MIMO rather than MISO. Both, eClass and FLEXFIS-Class methods are designed to work on a per-sample basis and are thus one-pass, incremental. Additionally, their structure (FRB) is evolving rather than fixed. It adapts their parameters in antecedent and consequent parts with any newly loaded sample. A special emphasis is placed on advanced issues for improving accuracy and robustness, including a thorough comparison between global and local learning of consequent functions, a novel approach for detecting of and reacting on drifts in the data streams and an enhanced outlier treatment strategy. The methods and their extensions according to the advanced issues are evaluated on one benchmark problem of handwritten images recognition as well as on a real-life problem of image classification framework, where images should be classified into good and bad ones during an on-line and interactive production process.},

  abstract = {The use of genetic algorithms (GAs) and other evolutionary optimization methods to design fuzzy rules for systems modeling and data classification have received much attention in recent literature. Authors have focused on various aspects of these randomized techniques, and a whole scale of algorithms have been proposed. We comment on some recent work and describe a new and efficient two-step approach that leads to good results for function approximation, dynamic systems modeling and data classification problems. First, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain a compact initial rule-based model. Then this model is optimized by a real-coded GA subjected to constraints that maintain the semantic properties of the rules. We consider four examples from the literature: a synthetic nonlinear dynamic systems model, the iris data classification problem, the wine data classification problem, and the dynamic modeling of a diesel engine turbocharger. The obtained results are compared to other recently proposed methods},

The initial model is derived from the data and subsequently, feature selection and rule-base simplification are applied to reduce the model, while a genetic algorithm is used for parameter optimization.

The goal is to construct a comprehensible fuzzy rule-based system from numerical input-output data. The comprehensibility of a fuzzy rule-based system is evaluated by three criteria: linguistic interpretability of fuzzy if-then rules; simplicity of fuzzy if-then rules; and compactness of a fuzzy rule-based system. We first illustrate the necessity of general rules with many "don't care" conditions when we try to construct compact fuzzy rule-based systems for high-dimensional problems without the exponential increase in the number of fuzzy if-then rules. Then we illustrate a fuzzy reasoning method for realizing default hierarchies of fuzzy if-then rules. Finally, we show how genetic algorithms can be utilized for generating a small number of fuzzy if-then rules from numerical input-output data.},

Restricted methods have been published, and their limitations are concerned mainly on the slow convergence and being trapped into local minima. To resolve the matter, this paper introduced in the fitness scaling genetic algorithm (FSGA) which conducted the heuristic search as the parameter optimization for rule-based classifier. The FSGA rule-based classifier was compared with GA, SA, and ACA, and the results prove that the proposed FSGA rule-based classifier is the most robust and rapid.},

  title = {A {{Learning System Based}} on {{Genetic Adaptive Algorithms}}},
  abstract = {A learning system is a system that improves its performance with respect to a given task domain over time through its interactions with the task environment. The mechanisms by which such a system manipulates its knowledge about the task environment in response to these interactions constitute the system's "methods of learning". In constructing an artificial learning system, the particular methods employed determine, to a large extent, the ultimate generality of the system. A learning system capable of functioning in a variety of task domains necessarily requires the presence of domain independent methods of learning.This thesis is concerned with investigating the feasibility of constructing a general purpose learning system around a particular class of domain independent methods called genetic algorithms. To this end, a specific learning system organization, LS-1, is proposed. In further specifying the design, a production system language amenable to manipulation by a genetic algorithm is defined as the system's representation of knowledge, organized as a domain independent framework into which task specific primitives can be injected. The classical genetic algorithms are then modified to suit the specific characteristics of the defined knowledge structure representation. A formal analysis of the search conducted by such a revised genetic algorithm through the space of possible production system programs is performed, demonstrating that it possesses properties analogous to those exhibited by classical genetic algorithms and establishing a sound theoretical foundation for LS-1. Finally, a critic to judge the "relative worth" of a production system program as a potential solution to the task at hand is specified, incorporating both domain independent and task specific sources of judgmental information.As a demonstration of the feasibility of the design an LS-1 implementation is tested in two distinct and unrelated task domains, each the domain of a related effort in learning system construction. Specifically, the system is faced with (1) a simple maze walk problem and (2) the problem of making the bet decision in draw poker. Initialized in each test with randomly generated production system programs, the LS-1 implementation is shown to rapidly converge on high performance knowledge structures in both task domains, providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of a genetic algorithm as a general purpose learning mechanism.},
